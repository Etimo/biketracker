# You'll need to regenerate the diagrams after editing their source code, you can run all such tasks by performing an export (in Emacs: M-x, org-html-export-to-html)
# If you don't do this then the rendered diagrams will not be updated, and instead keep showing the old version.

#+Title: Biketracker

Track your (desk) bikes! This program allows you to track how far users bike and show it in a decent HTML widget, ready to embed to your website.

* Get Started (to develop locally)

These instructions should work on Linux/macOS/Windows, but the quality of testing is in roughly that order.

** Database

- Install Dependencies
  - Install Rustup (https://rustup.rs/) and PostgreSQL
  - Install Migrant (~cargo install migrant~)
- Create database:
  - ~createuser biketracker --password=feKui9Be~ (example password, use something else in prod)
  - ~createdb biketracker --owner=biketracker~
- Apply migrations:
  - ~pushd biketracker-server && migrant apply --all && popd~

** Server

- Set up the database (see above)
- Switch to the server folder:
  - ~cd biketracker-server~
- Compile and run:
  - ~cargo run~

** Agent

- Set up the Server (see above)
- Switch to the agent folder:
  - ~cd biketracker-agent~
- Compile and run:
  - ~cargo run~

*** Notes

- macOS/Windows: You'll need to disable Bluetooth support when running the agent, do
  this by passing the passing cargo run the argument ~--no-default-features~.
  Then you'll need to use the fake bike by setting ~bike.type~ to ~Fake~ in [[./biketracker-agent/Config.toml]].
- macOS: Currently the agent only works in Release mode on macOS. Enable this by giving ~cargo run~ the
  argument ~--release~.

** Dashboard

- Set up the database (as above)
- Install [[https://grafana.com/][Grafana]]
- Create a Datasource that connects to the PostgreSQL in the Grafana GUI
  - Note: Make sure to create a separate read-only user in prod, rather than reusing the server's user
- Import [[./grafana-config.json]] in the Grafana GUI

** Agent

Connects to the bike, records how far you travel, and transmits it to the [[Server][Server]] once the session is over.
Also presents a GUI showing the user how far they've travelled, and which lets them log in/out.

This component should be cross-platform, but Bluetooth functionality only works on Linux.

Located in [[./biketracker-agent]].

** Server

Listens for the [[Agent][Agent]] asking to record sessions, and saves them to the database.

Located in [[./biketracker-server]].

** Grafana

Collects statistics from the database, and presents them to the user. Also provides embeddable widgets (to
show off on the website, for example).

A third party component available at [[https://grafana.com/]]. Our configuration is located in [[./grafana-config.json]].

** Database

A Postgres database with the data collected from the user. The schema is managed using [[https://github.com/jaemk/migrant][Migrant]].

** Bike

A bike that supports the Bluetooth LE CSC (Cycling Speed + Cadence) profile. In theory any CSC bike should work
(if the code is adjusted to connect to it), but we've only tested against a [[https://www.deskbike.com/en/][Deskbike]].

There is also a fake bike for testing purposes.

* Installing an Agent Device

- Install [[https://archlinuxarm.org/][Arch Linux ARM]] to SD card
- Boot Raspberry Pi
- Run the following (on the Pi):

#+begin_src shell-script :exports code
  # Install dependencies
  curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
  pacman -Syu git bluez base-devel

  # Clone repo
  git clone https://github.com/etimo/biketracker
  pushd biketracker

  # Install PiTFT driver
  pushd pkgbuilds/rpi-fbcp
  makepkg --install
  popd

  # Compile Biketracker
  pushd biketracker-server
  cargo build --release
  popd

  popd
#+end_src

- Set up a systemd unit

(According to memory, some details may be ommitted)

** Why Arch Linux (rather than Raspbian)

Raspbian 9 (Stretch, the current Stable) only ships BlueZ 5.43, but Blurz only supports 5.44 and newer. Raspbian
10 (Buster, the current Testing) ships BlueZ 5.50, but also ships an X server that doesn't like to cooperate with
the PiTFT.

Arch supports both BlueZ 5.50 and a working X server.
